UnQuote Examples (8/Apr/15)

UnQuote is an F# testing framework which cane be used in conjunction with some of the more popular 
testing frameworks like FSCheck, NUnit or XUnit. With UnQuote a developer is able to see a print out 
of all processes of a function which they are testing. 

In the example below we evaluate the code on line 73 which has brackets so we know that this gets 
evaluated first (1 + 2) and then the answer from the previous equation is divided by 3 so the answer 
is obviously 1. With most testing frameworks we assert that a result is equal to an expected result. 
This is also the same with UnQuote but it is capable of giving a print out of each equation as it 
is evaluated as we see in the second snippet. This negates the need for a programmer to debug the 
his or hers code to find a problem. This is UnQuote in its simplest form.
